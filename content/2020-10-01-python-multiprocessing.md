## Libraries

* Standard [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)

* [Pebble](https://pypi.org/project/Pebble/) 
  \- pretty close to the standard one, but with a bit nicer interface

* [Dask](https://dask.org/) 
  \- well maintained and (almost) drop-in replacement of numpy and pandas:

```python
# Arrays implement the Numpy API
import dask.array as da
x = da.random.random(size=(10000, 10000),
                     chunks=(1000, 1000))
x + x.T - x.mean(axis=0)

# Dataframes implement the Pandas API
import dask.dataframe as dd
df = dd.read_csv('s3://.../2018-*-*.csv')
df.groupby(df.account_id).balance.sum()

# Dask-ML implements the Scikit-Learn API
from dask_ml.linear_model \
  import LogisticRegression
lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(train, test)
```

* [mptools](https://github.com/PamelaM/mptools) - seems like an abandoned project.
  The autor had a nice article though: 
  [Things I Wish They Told Me About Multiprocessing in Python](https://www.cloudcity.io/blog/2019/02/27/things-i-wish-they-told-me-about-multiprocessing-in-python/)

## Using Pipes for parallel stateful processes

Let's consider the following task. We have to implement a controller.
The controller defines a processing graph with 4 interconnected stages:

* detector

* size_estimator (depends on detector)

* classifier (depends on detector)

* aggregator (depends on size_estimator and classifier)

This could be a model for some computer vision pipeline and controller processes frames coming from a camera.

Sequential version of the controller could look like this
```python
class Controller:
    def __init__(self):
        self.detector = Detector()
        self.size_estimator = Processor(fn=_compute_size)
        self.classifier = Processor(fn=_obj_to_class)
        self.aggregator = Aggregator()
        self.stats = []

    def __call__(self, frame):
        objects = self.detector(frame)
        sizes = self.size_estimator(objects)
        classes = self.classifier(objects)
        stat = self.aggregator(sizes, classes)
        self.stats.append(stat)

    def finish(self):
        pass

```

Usage of the controller:
```python
def execute_test(controller):
    num_frames = 10
    t = time.time()
    for i in range(num_frames):
        frame = np.empty((100, 100), dtype='uint8')
        controller(frame)
    controller.finish()
    t = time.time() - t
    print(f"FPS: {num_frames / t}")
    return t
``` 

As I have mentioned above two stages - size estimation and classification can be executed in parallel. 
A standard solution for that could be `multiprocessing.Pool` with a function like `map` or `imap`.
That works if our processing stages don't have the state and initialization of `size_estimator` and `classifier`
are cheap.
It is not always the case. 
If `classifier` requires a slow initialization, e.g. loading a big neural network into memory, it would be 
nice to have it initialized only once. We can create a process for that. 

Communication between parallel processes is a dangerous thing. Let's try to use `multiprocessing.Pipe` for that.

```python
class ParallelPipeController:
    def __init__(self, size_estimator_factory=lambda: Processor(fn=_compute_size)):
        self.pipe_size_estimator, pipe_size_worker = Pipe()

        self.detector = Detector()
        self.size_estimator = Process(
            target=pipe_worker,
            args=(pipe_size_worker, size_estimator_factory),
            daemon=True
        )
        self.classifier = Processor(fn=_obj_to_class)
        self.aggregator = Aggregator()
        self.stats = []
        self.size_estimator.start()

    def __call__(self, frame):
        objects = self.detector(frame)
        self.pipe_size_estimator.send(objects)
        classes = self.classifier(objects)
        try:
            sizes = self.pipe_size_estimator.recv()
        except EOFError as e:
            raise RuntimeError("Unable to get data from process. Probably exception occurred") from e
        stat = self.aggregator(sizes, classes)
        self.stats.append(stat)

    def finish(self):
        self.pipe_size_estimator.send(None)
        self.size_estimator.join()

```

`pipe_worker` would look like this:

```python
def pipe_worker(pipe, factory: Callable):
    try:
        print("worker started")
        processor = factory()
        while True:
            msg = pipe.recv()
            if msg is None:
                break
            result = processor(msg)
            pipe.send(result)
        print("worker exited correctly")
    except Exception:
        print("An exception occurred. We notify the main process by closing our end of the pipe."
              "It would be nicer to send some info to the main process.")
        pipe.close()
```

Comparing those two controllers:
```python
print("sequential")
execute_test(Controller())
print("parallel")
execute_test(ParallelPipeController())
```
   
Sample output:
    
    sequential
    FPS: 1.7753397948365568
    parallel
    worker started
    worker exited correctly
    FPS: 2.820896038347416
