<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Looks like it is too early for using scipy in Pypy. There is a plenty of dependencies on C-code there.
I was able to install scipy 0.17 in pypy. I disabled all failed dependencies. Unfortunately it is completely useless. Almost everything doesn't work.
