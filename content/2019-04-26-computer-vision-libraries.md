So, what else is there except for opencv...

### CCV 
[CCV website](libccv.org), [github](libccv.org)

CCV 0.7 comes with a sub-10% image classifier, a decent face detector.


> It runs on Mac OSX, Linux, FreeBSD, Windows*, iPhone, iPad, Android, Raspberry Pi. In fact, anything that has a proper C compiler probably can run ccv. The majority (with notable exception of convolutional networks, which requires a BLAS library) of ccv will just work with no compilation flags or dependencies.

List of algorithms:
* TLD: Track Learn Detect
* SWT: Stroke Width Transform
* SIFT: Scale Invariant Feature Transform
* SCD: SURF-Cascade Detection
* ICF: Integral Channel Features
* HTTP: A REST-ful API
* DPM: Deformable Parts Model
* ConvNet: Deep Convolutional Networks
* Cache: We are Terrible Magicians
* BBF: Brightness Binary Feature
