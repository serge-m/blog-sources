Here will be some notes on ROS.


## ROS on raspberry pi
There is a compiled image by ubiquity that contain ROS kinetic.

[https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html).

It seems for me too old. It's 2019, there are ubuntu 18, ros melodic and ros2, next year the support of python2.7 will be discontinued. Meh... 


## Installing tensorflow for ROS on raspberry pi
Alternatively one can try to install it from wheels:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip?lang=python3#package-location

The dependencies are better to install using pip and piwheels.org:
```
sudo pip3 install --extra-index-url=https://www.piwheels.org/simple -U tensorflow keras
```

I encountered an error about h5py: 
```
ImportError: libhdf5_serial.so.100: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
installing 
```
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev
```
didnt help.

Some version mismatch

I could resolve it by compiling h5py with my version:
```
HDF5_VERSION=1.8.16 sudo pip3 install --no-binary=h5py h5py
```
