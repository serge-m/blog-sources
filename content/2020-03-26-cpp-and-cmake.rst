CMake in VSCode
===============================

VSCode is a free open source IDE with a lot of nice features. In addition one can chose from a variety of extensions.
I couldnt find a good extension for CMake integration that works out of box. I tried to make use of Cmake-tools and it kind of works, but
the hotkeys and some settings are far from intuitive now (2020-03).

Therefore I ended up removing ``cmake tools`` plugin and moving forward with custom taks.json and launch.json scripts.

Here is my VSCode+Cmake template for small projects:

Getting started with Gtest
=====================================

For any decent project in Cpp it's good to set up testing system. For C++ the standard solution is to use Gtest.

Installing Gtest in your ubuntu is not very straightforward. You have to install the package containing source code and then compile it with cmake with sudo rights.

.. code-block:: none

    sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
    sudo apt-get install cmake # install cmake
    cd /usr/src/gtest
    sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
    sudo make

    # copy or symlink libgtest.a and libgtest_main.a to your /usr/lib folder
    sudo cp *.a /usr/lib


Many projects use alternative approach. They clone GTest sources from github into the source tree of the project and compile it in-place.
That requires some custom scripting in your cmake files.

Handling dependencies in CMake
=====================================================

If i need to import a compiled 3rdparty library to my cmake project:

.. code-block:: none

    add_library(some_library SHARED IMPORTED)
    set_property(TARGET some_library PROPERTY IMPORTED_LOCATION "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/some_library.so")
    set_property(TARGET some_library PROPERTY INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/")



CMake with Conan and Catch2
=====================================================

Here is a sample CMake project that uses Conan for dependency management and Catch2 for testing:
