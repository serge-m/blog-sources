UPD: It seems that the current solution (2019) is VSCode. It's free and powerful. There is a plenty of plugins. 

CLion is awesome but expensive.


Found [Codelite](http://www.codelite.org) on [http://stackoverflow.com/a/1775460](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1775460).
Looks good. No disgust after 10 minutes of work.

I was able to debug C code of Numpy in Virtualenv.

1. Launched from console after activating of virtual environment
`> source ./<path to activate>/activate`

2. add breakpoints

3. Run (F5)
