## SSH don't scan all keys in .ssh directory
```
$ ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -F /dev/null -i ~/path/to/some_id_rsa root@server.mydom.com
```

The options are as follows:

* `-o IdentitiesOnly=yes` - tells SSH to only use keys that are provided via the CLI and none from the `$HOME/.ssh` or via ssh-agent
* `-F /dev/null` - disables the use of `$HOME/.ssh/config`
* `-i ~/path/to/some_id_rsa` - the key that you explicitly want to use for the connection

## Configuring SSH server
Enable only ssh v2:
```
Protocol 2
```

Disable password authentification. Replace corresponding values in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
```
[source](https://support.hostgator.com/articles/how-to-disable-password-authentication-for-ssh)

Restrict SSH access to only user accounts that should have it. For example, you may create a group called "sshlogin" and add the group name as the value associated with the `AllowGroups` variable located in the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
```
AllowGroups sshlogin
```
Then add your permitted SSH users to the group "sshlogin", and restart the SSH service.
```
sudo adduser username sshlogin
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```
[source](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/user-management.html.en#other-security-considerations)

restart sshd service
```
service sshd restart
```

### Add user for ssh tunnel only
```
useradd sshtunnel -m -d /home/sshtunnel -s /bin/rbash
passwd sshtunnel
```

in `.profile` in the home directory of the user (in our example it is /home/sshtunnel/):
```
PATH=""
```

Forbid changes:

```
chmod 555 /home/sshtunnel/
cd /home/sshtunnel/
chmod 444 .bash_logout .bashrc .profile
```

### How To Configure SSH Key-Based Authentication on a Linux Server 

See [How To Configure SSH Key-Based Authentication on a Linux Server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server). Should I put public or private key to the server?


### Use ssh authentication by key instead of password

## How to load ssh key without placing it to ~/.ssh
You must load a key to the ssh agent running in the background.

To start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 59566
```

You can add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent using `ssh-add` and full path to the key:
```bash
    ssh-add ~/path_to_your_private_key/id_rsa
```

Now you can for example do `git clone` from github using ssh key.
