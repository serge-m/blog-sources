## Connection via OPenVPN is slow for https
Try the following [advice](https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?t=21857)
The udp connection is perfect with these parameters (in client config):
```
mssfix 1200
tun-mtu 1200
```

## DNS doesn't work through VPN
Symptoms: Openvpn connects, you can ping web sites by IP address, but you cannot ping them by name (like ping `google.com`)

[Solution](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvpn/+bug/1211110):

This is a bug that's fixed in upstream NetworkManager. That said, the various GUI tools which write the NetworkManager config files haven't been updated to ensure that DNS leaks are prevented when using vpn connections.

To prevent system dns from appearing and being used in `/etc/resolv.conf` when using a VPN, edit your vpn configuration (i.e. the file in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<vpn name>) so it's something like this:

```
[ipv4]
dns=<vpn dns server ip address>;
ignore-auto-dns=true
method=auto
dns-priority=-1
```

the negative dns-priority means only this dns server will be used.
Then reload the config file:
```
sudo nmcli c reload <vpn name>
```

and toggle the vpn.

/etc/resolv.conf should now only include the one dns ip address defined in the config file.

## OpenVPN setup notes

Download easyrsa for ca:
[github](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/releases)

#### On CA
```sh
root@a1aaf3e31e3a:/easyrsa# ./easyrsa init-pki

init-pki complete; you may now create a CA or requests.
Your newly created PKI dir is: /easyrsa/pki

```
build-ca:

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Common Name (eg: your user, host, or server name) [Easy-RSA CA]:test-ca

CA creation complete and you may now import and sign cert requests.
Your new CA certificate file for publishing is at:
/easyrsa/pki/ca.crt

```

Copy `ca.crt`.

```shell

Copy `crl.pem`


#### On server

Copy `server.req` to CA.

#### On CA
Import:
```
root@8bb29470d5c0:/easyrsa# ./easyrsa import-req /ca/pki/import/server.req vpn-server

The request has been successfully imported with a short name of: vpn-server
You may now use this name to perform signing operations on this request.

```
Sign:
```
root@8bb29470d5c0:/easyrsa# ./easyrsa sign-req server vpn-server
