Here I will collect links to well-written articles about math and algorithms. 

[Visual Information Theory](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/). Nice post about probabilities, entropy. The [whole blog](http://colah.github.io/) has awesome visualizations. Highly recommended.

[MNIST For ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners) - Nice introduction into machine learning with TensorFlow
