[TensorFlow Serving](https://tensorflow.github.io/serving), [sources[(https://github.com/tensorflow/serving) - library for serving machine learning models. Written in C++ and Python. Server is in C++. 
Requires [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) - Google's build tool. Doesn't work with python 3. Probably fast.
