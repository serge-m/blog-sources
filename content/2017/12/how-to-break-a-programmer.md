## How to make an engineer to accept your crazy idea
* Invite him/her to a 2-4 hour meeting. It can also be several meeting. But within one day.
* Don't send an agenda. It is better to be spontaneous!
* Speak loud. The louder you are, the smarter you seem!
* Don't bring any objective proofs or measurements that support your idea. Operate with terms that noone can measure.
* Interrupt often
* Use a killer feature to support your idea. For example: "my solution is better because we have to build **microservices**", 
or "this architecture allows **decoupling**", or "**spark** is an **industry standard**"
