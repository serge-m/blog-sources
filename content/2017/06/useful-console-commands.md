## Scan IP range

Generally, nmap is useful to quickly scan networks.

To install nmap, enter
```
sudo apt-get install nmap
```
Once it is installed, enter
```
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```
This will show you which hosts responded to ping requests on the network between 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255.

## Replace text in files

```
find . -type f | xargs sed -i "s/text_to_find/text_to_put/g"
```
To keep original files with `.original` extension:
```
find . -type f | xargs sed -i.original "s/text_to_find/text_to_put/g"
```

If your text contain slashes, you should use another delimiter:
```
find . -type f | xargs sed -i.original "s|text/to/find/|text/to/put|g"
```
