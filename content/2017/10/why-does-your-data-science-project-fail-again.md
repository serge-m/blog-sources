[Work in progress]

You work in a mid size company. Business goes well. Engineering department is split into many small teams. One of them works on data intense project. Like rooting of parcels from a warehouse or demand prediction for millions of sales per month. Everything is ok, but upgrading from very basic algorithm that is here from the beginning fails miserably. Maybe it fails multiple times in a row. Changing leads and even heads of the department doesn't help. 

Well old system works. It is obsolete, too slow, has bad precision but the team


# your data scientists aren't real scientists

# you don't perform reproducible experiments

# you don't measure your performance

# you have only engineers in your team
Many tasks cannot be done by pure engineers. These guys can build robust architectures, they write reliable and maintainable code, they understand concepts of testing and continuous integration. But they don't know how to approach research. They may tell you they know and continue trying solving research topics with building a new super flexible architecture instead of experimenting and discovering solutions. They prefer depth first search instead of breadth first search. Write what you really need is a combination of both.

# you are afraid of changes

## technical changes
You probably don't have tests, you deploy rarely and you don't maintain your code clean.

## business rules changes
You don't have high level acceptance tests.

# you don't really need data science
Business people 99% of the cases don't need complicated, powerful algorithms. They need some linear models and ability to play with parameters. They need fast and reliable enough simulations and ability to fix the errors or steer the parameters.
