I often need to perform some operations on video. Usually I use linux and ffmpeg to do that, but I strugle to remember all the commands.
Therefore I usually google it. I'll try to collect here some recipes that I usually use with a bit of explanations.

Video conversions
==========================

Cut a range of frames
---------------------------

Cut a range of frames (100, 130) from a video and save it to mp4 with a good quality using x264 codec:

.. code-block:: sh

  ffmpeg -i ./input_video.mp4 -vf "select=between(n\,100\,130)" -vsync 0 -vcodec libx264 -crf 15 -an ./output.mp4


Explanation:

* ``-vf "select=between(n\,100\,130)"`` - cut according to the frame numbers. Slash symbols are essential.

* ``-vsync 0`` - some synchronization magic. Without it some duplicated/ freezed frames are added.

* ``-crf 15`` - good quality, large output file. set to a bigger value if you need more compression.

* ``-an`` removes audio from the file. otherwise some black frames are added. I think there is a way to cut audio track as well, I just don't need it usually.



Cut according to time (between seconds 5.5 and 122):

.. code-block:: sh

    ffmpeg -y -i ./input_video.mp4 -vf "select=between(t\,5.5\,122)" -vsync 0 -vcodec libx264 -crf 15 -an ./output.mp4



Convert to jpeg
---------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    ffmpeg -i ./input_video.mp4 -qmax 1 -qmin 1 -start_number 0 output_image_%05d.jpg
